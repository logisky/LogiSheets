# LogiSheets Development

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the development of **LogiSheets**.

In this project, we aim to build the best spreadsheet application while exploring best practices for integrating Rust and TypeScript.

## Concept

**LogiSheets** is a Rust-based library, a web component, and possibly a collaborative product in the future. For now, we use the name "LogiSheets" to refer to all these concepts.

## Development Environment

We are using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to set up the development environment. To get started, simply run:

```bash
nix develop
```
