# LogiSheets

## What is LogiSheets?

LogiSheets is a web-based spreadsheet application that seamlessly integrates with Excel and is crafted for expansion. Notably, it comes at no cost!

You can utilize the Rust crate and Node package to efficiently read, perform operations, and write .xlsx files.

We are also working on a user interface to enable users to use spreadsheets directly in their web browsers.

## WARNING

This version is specifically used for browsers. If you are seeking a version used in Node, please see `logisheets`.

LogiSheets is currently in its **early development** stages. We welcome your feedback, issues, or pull requests!
