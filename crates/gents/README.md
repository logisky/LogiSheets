`gents` is a tool for generating **Typescript** interfaces from **Rust** code.
We can easily use `serde-json` to communicate between **Rust** and **Typescript**,
without writing **Typescript** stubs trivially.
It is designed for [LogiSheets](https://github.com/proclml/LogiSheets) and
is inspired by [`ts-rs`](https://github.com/Aleph-Alpha/ts-rs).

Your issues and PRs are welcome!

## Why do we need `gents` instead of `ts-rs`?

- `ts-rs` generates the files when running `cargo test` and in this way we must
commit those generated files into our repo.
It is not necessary and is even an obstacle when we use `bazel` as our building tool.
`gents` acts as a binary to generate **Typescript** files.

- `gents` introduces a concept *Group* that from all the members in
this group files generated will be placed in the same directory. **Group** is seperate from the others even though they can share some
dependecies. Therefore, `gents` requires you specify the *file_name* on structs
or enums and specify the *dir* on group, while `ts-rs` requires specifing the *path* on every item.

- `gents` helps you manage the export files. `gents` gathers all the dependencies automatically.

- Code generated by `ts-rs` is not match our coding style.

Many thanks to `ts-rs` because it helps `gents` a lot.

## How to use `gents`?

In your **Rust** code:

```rust
use gents::TS;

#[derive(TS)]
#[ts(file_name = "person.ts", rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct Person {
    pub age: u16,
    pub en_name: String,
}

#[derive(TS)]
#[ts(file_name = "group.ts", rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct Group {
    pub name: String,
    pub capacity: u16,
    pub members: Vec<Person>,
    pub leader: Option<Person>,
}
```

And you should make a binary to generate the files like below:

```rust
use gents::FileGroup;

fn main() {
    let mut group = FileGroup::new();
    group.add::<Group>();
    // If you need to generate the index.ts file, set true.
    group.gen_files("outdir", false);
}
```

After running the binary, there are 2 files generated in `outdir`:

- person.ts
- group.ts
