# LogiSheets Workbook

This crate defines the structs and enums of `OOXML` and uses [xmlserde](https://github.com/ImJeremyHe/xmlserde) to read and write the XML files.

These are only the structs and enums `LogiSheets` needs currently and maybe it is not compatible somewhere. **Use this crate at your risk.**
